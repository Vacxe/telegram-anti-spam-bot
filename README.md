---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps

Follow these steps to get your Telegram antispam bot up and running:

### 1. Create a Log Group

* Create a **Telegram group** that will serve as the **log/admin chat**.
* Add `@spam_eater_bot` to the group.
* Grant the bot **admin permissions** (at minimum: read messages and send messages).

This group will receive logs and alerts about spam detection and actions taken.

### 2. Get the Chat ID

Send the `/get_chat_id` command in the log group.

* The bot will reply with the group‚Äôs ID.
* **Copy this value** ‚Äî you'll need it in the next steps.

### 3. Add the Bot to Your Main Chat

* Invite `@spam_eater_bot` to the chat you want to protect.
* Give it **admin permissions**:

  * Can delete messages
  * Can restrict members
  * Can read all messages

### 4. Enable the Bot

In your main chat, send the following command:

```text
/enable
```

This activates spam filtering for the group.

### 5. Set the Log Chat ID

Back in your main chat, link the log group by sending:

```text
/set_admin_chat_id <your_log_chat_id>
```

Example:

```text
/set_admin_chat_id -1001234567890
```

You're all set! üõ°Ô∏è The bot is now actively protecting your group and logging its actions.

## üß™ Setup Filters
After adding and enabling the bot in your chat, you can configure its behavior using custom filters.

## üì• Upload Filter Configuration
To use your own filter rules:

Open the log/admin chat (the one you linked with /set_admin_chat_id).

Send the file filters.yaml as a document (not as text or photo).

The bot will automatically load and apply the filters from the file.

* ‚úÖ You‚Äôll see a confirmation message if the filters were loaded successfully.
* ‚ùå If there‚Äôs an error in the file format, the bot will send a warning message.

Here's a clear and detailed documentation section for the **Weight Filter**, based on the entries in your provided `filters.yaml`:

---

## üîç Filters

Each filter contains several common paramenters:
* **`enable`**: Enable or disable the filter
* **`quarantineWeight`**: Score contribution toward quarantine the user. (Should be lower than banWeight)
* **`banWeight`**: Score contribution toward banning the user.
* **`inputTransformer`**: Preprocesses the message before evaluation (e.g., `remove_unicode`, `lowercase`).

When a user sends a message:

1. The input is transformed according to the filter‚Äôs rules.
2. The message is checked against the filter.
3. If a match is found, the filter contributes to the total **quarantine** or **ban** score.
4. If the total score crosses the defined threshold for action, the bot responds accordingly.
5. Filters invoked one by one in chain, until first of them will return **ban** score. Otherwise in the end the message can be quarantined if **quarantine** score acheived.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the filters defined in your `filters.yaml`, formatted for your documentation. Each filter is categorized and described with clear YAML references and explanations.

---

### 1. üåê **Language Injection Detection** (`language_injection` filter example)

```yaml
type: language_injection
name: 'Injection in russian words'
strictLanguagePattern: '[A-Za-z]'
quarantineWeight: 2
banWeight: 3
inputTransformer:
  type: remove_unicode
```

* Detects messages that mix non-Latin symbols into Engligh text.
* Helps stop injection-style spam using obfuscated characters.

---

### 2. üòä **Emoji Limit Filter** (`weight` filter example for emoji)

```yaml
type: weight
name: 'Emoji Limit'
restrictionPatterns:
  - '[^\\p{L}\\p{M}\\p{N}\\p{P}\\p{Z}\\p{Cf}\\p{Cs}\\s[!-/][:-@][\\[-`][{-~]]'
quarantineWeight: 5
banWeight: 10
inputTransformer:
  type: pass
```

* Detects excessive or suspicious use of emojis or non-standard Unicode.
* High score leads to direct banning due to likely spam nature.

---

### 3. ü§ñ **AI Spam Model Filter** (`remote_filter` filter example)

```yaml
type: remote_filter
name: 'AI Spam Model'
endpoint: <Your remote API endpoint>
minMessageLengthForCheck: 40
enabled: true
quarantineWeight: 0.3
banWeight: 0.98
inputTransformer:
  type: pass
```

* Sends longer messages to an external AI spam detection API.
* Contributes partial weights depending on classification.

---

### 4. üí∞ **Strong Restricted Words** (`weight` filter example)

```yaml
type: weight
name: 'Strong restricted words'
restrictionPatterns:
  - '\\d+\\s*[$]'
  - '[$]\\s*\\d+'
  - '18\\s*[+]'
  - '\\s\\d{3}k'
  - 'usd'
  - 'eur'
  - 'income'
  - 'bitcoin'

quarantineWeight: 1
banWeight: 2
inputTransformer:
  type: combine
  transformers:
    - type: remove_unicode
    - type: lowercase
```

* Matches explicit monetary patterns and aggressive financial bait.
* Minimal weight allows stacking with other filters for high accuracy.
